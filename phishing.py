#DATA ANALYSIS
#1. Analyze the data.
#2. We will load the phishing.csv file into the dataframe.
#3. Then we will study the relation between the parametres and the result label.
#4. We will then find out which parameters are significant and impact the results.
#5. We will also analyze the nature of relationship (linear, exponential) between parameters and the result variable.
#6. We will also analyze the data quality such as data completeness and consistency.

#DATA PREPARATION
#1. We will clean the data parameters to remove null values and empty figures.
#2. We will ensure that the result column is not empty and has the correct labels.
#3. we will also identify outliers and cardinality of the set.
#4. we will also visualize relationship between feautures. We will do normalization of the data and binning.

#MODELLING AND EVALUATION
#1. We will identify the machine learnig regression model that can be applied to the data.
#2. We will evaluate the model for its efficiency and we will use it to predict the future data.

#DEPLOYMENT
#1. We will deploy this model over cloud as a service.
